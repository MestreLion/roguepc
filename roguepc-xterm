# XTerm options

# -uc
#	Makes the cursor underlined instead of a box.
#
#  Just like DOS :)

# -bc
#	Turn on text cursor blinking.
#
#  Annoying, but faithful to original

# -b 0
#	Specifies the size of the inner border
#
#  No border by default, just like DOSBox ;)

# +bdc
#	Display characters with bold attribute as color rather than bold.
#
#  Not really needed, as bold is not used under 256 color mode set by `-tn`.

# +fbx
#	Assume that the normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters.
#
#  This improves the resolution and disable color AA of line and box drawing
#  chars such as U+2592 "▒", used in Rogue for passages, mazes, curtain and zoom
#  animations. It enhances their visual display and also make sure they nicely
#  connect vertically and horizontaly regadless of the True Type font size.
#  On the other hand, this is an enchancement not in original Rogue, so it's
#  disabled by default.

# -fa 'Perfect DOS VGA 437 Unicode'
#	Specifies the pattern for the font selected from the FreeType library.
#
#  Selecting the custom DOS 437 font with IBM VGA glyphs.

# -geometry 80x25
#	Specifies the preferred size and position of the VT102 window.
#
#  Rogue default size is 80x25, and it also has a 40x25 mode. Currently columns
#  are a compile-time option, so for now it's set to 80.

# -fs 24
#	Sets the pointsize for fonts selected from the FreeType library
#
#  Current custom font requires a multiple of 3 for best results, 12 for 1:1
#  matching. 24 satisfies both and is large enough to look great while still
#  fitting a 1280x800 screen. 30 is the largest good-looking size to fit a
#  Full HD 1920x1080 monitor

# -title 'Rogue PC'
#	Specifies the window title string, (...) the default is the command line
#	specified after the -e option, if any.
#
#  "Rogue PC" is better than "rogue", "roguepc" or "xterm"

# -tn 'xterm-256color'
#	Specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the TERM environment
#	variable. (...) This terminal type must exist in the terminal database.
#	(...) If the terminal type is not found, xterm uses the built-in list
#	“xterm”, “vt102”, etc.
#
#  Enable 256 colors.

# -fg gray
#	Specifies the color to use for displaying text
#
#  xterm default usually is white

# -bg black
#	Specifies the color to use for the background of the window
#
#  xterm default usually is already black
